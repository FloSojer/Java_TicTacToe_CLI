# Java_TicTacToe_CLI
Created OOP Tic Tac Toe with Java. Pretty Basic Programming, some lines may have a better solution but that was the best i might have done for myself.  
This is an IntelliJ Project.

The Main class is kept as simple and short as possible.
Feld.Java sets the Gamefield and it's places.
PlayerHum, means Player Human, sets the Player facts as Name and Sign to play.
In the Game.Java file is the whole Gameplay as Check player sign, choose which player should start and check for Win.
